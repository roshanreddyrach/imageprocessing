initialize npn init -y
basically this will create an empty package.json file 
now we need to install the dependencies
* express which will be our server
* multer will be the library which will upload the images on the server
* nodemon which will automatically restart the server 

next will will be using a special library which is image size in oder to get the dimensions of image

package.json file will contain the default information about the project such as name version and description
aand here we need to make two changes 
* we need to make a Start script so, we can use this script in Heroku
* devStart script which we will use inside the development process
 "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "devStart":"nodemon index.js"
  }

  npm run devStart in terminal 

  index.js will be the starting point of the application so, 
  * here we will make a simple express server 
  const express = require("express");
  * then we will make simple express app
  const app = express();
